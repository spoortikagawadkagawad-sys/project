Data Preparation and Exploration: The dataset was loaded, and initial checks confirmed no missing values or duplicates. Categorical features like 'Customer Name', 'Country', 'Category', etc., were converted into numerical representations using LabelEncoder, which is crucial for machine learning models.
Initial Modeling with Linear Regression: A LinearRegression model was trained, but it yielded a relatively low R2 score of approximately 0.36. This suggested that a simple linear relationship might not fully capture the complexity of 'Profit' prediction.
Visual Data Analysis: Various visualizations were generated to understand the data distribution and relationships: scatter plots explored 'Sales', 'Discount', and 'Quantity' against 'Profit'; histograms showed the distributions of 'Profit' and 'Sales'; bar plots illustrated total profit by 'Category', 'Segment', and 'Region'; and a correlation heatmap revealed relationships between numerical features.
Refined Modeling with Random Forest Regressor: A RandomForestRegressor was then trained, demonstrating a significant improvement with an R2 score of approximately 0.69. This model proved to be much more effective at explaining the variance in 'Profit' compared to the linear model.
Prediction: The trained RandomForestRegressor was successfully used to make predictions on new, unseen data, showcasing its practical application.
